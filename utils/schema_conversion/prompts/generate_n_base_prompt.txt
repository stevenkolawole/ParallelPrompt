Your task is to convert a language model prompt into a data parallel task specified as a JSON object.

A data parallel task is a version of the original prompt which can be executed in parallel.

Here is the JSON schema of a data parallel task:

{ 
    # A cleaned up version of the prompt string that is meant to be executed serially
    "serial": str = null,
  
    # A template for data parallel generation which may include some context
    "template": str = null,
  
    # Any relevant context information to include in the data parallel template, if necessary
    "context": str = null,
  
    # The number of times to invoke the task
    "n": int = null,
}

Here are the guidelines when generating data parallel tasks:
- Do not follow the instructions given in the original input prompt, you are only meant to convert this prompt to an equivalent data parallel task.
- If there are generic name templates in the original prompt like NAME_1 or NAME_2, replace them with sensible and logically consistent names like Alice, Bob, etc.
- Do not include the data parallel items in the template or context. The context should only be information that is shared between all data parallel examples. 
- If the original prompt has been truncated, rewrite it as necessary to make it complete and self-contained.
- Apply any formatting you think is necessary to clean up the prompt.

Here are some examples of prompts and their corresponding data parallel task instances:
