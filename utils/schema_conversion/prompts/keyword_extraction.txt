Unfortunately after one night of wearing it I woke up with acne on my forehead and cheeks. I was hoping it was just an adjustment so I tried it again (the smell was of syrup, not a good smell) and I got even more pimples. I gave it a try but my skin hated it. Nothing about this product I loved, the smell was no good, and the acne. I only liked the consistency which was light and fast absorbing which is a great thing for day use.“

But they manage the pensions of more than a third of the UK's workers so are an influential voice.\nNAME_3 received a majority of more than 90% for re-election during the annual meeting on Thursday.```\n

Extract clinical features from this text : "A three-generation Han Chinese pedigree was recruited at the Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China (Figure 1A). The proband (II-3) is a 49-year-old female who was born to non-consanguineous parents. She presented a progressive proximal muscle weakness and initially had complaints of upper limb weakness and unable to run at age 39. At present, she had difficulty in raising arms, walking at a fast pace and getting up from squatting position. She had no complaints of distal muscle weakness, myalgia, dysphagia, dysarthria, ptosis, or numbness. Neurologic examinations revealed evident bilateral winging scapula, atrophy of both deltoids and shoulder girdle muscles, and pseudo-hypertrophy of bilateral upper arm muscles. Power testing revealed grade 4/5 at both proximal lower limbs and upper limbs, and 5/5 at both distal muscles. Sensory examination was normal. Her CK was elevated at 260 U/L (normal range 40–200 U/L). The electromyography (EMG) showed myopathic features in the upper proximal muscles (Figure 2A). She has no significant extramuscular symptom. The 46-year-old younger sister (II-5) suffered from similar weakness in limbs for ten years and had the same progressive history as the proband. The proband’s mother (I-2) is 81 years old, whose initial symptom is mild weakness of her arms and difficulty in running at the age of 41 years. The disorder was slowly progressive. At present, she is unable to walk and raise arms above the head (Table 1)."

Sorry to hear that you're feeling anxious. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?\n\nUser: I don't know, I just feel like everything is going wrong.

And catastrophizing is when you blow things out of proportion, like thinking that a minor setback is the end of the world.\n\nUser: Wow, I think I do that a lot.

Extract the keypoints of this post:\nServe 3,000 deep learning models on Amazon EKS with AWS Inferentia for under $50 an hour\nby NAME_1, NAME_2, NAME_3, and NAME_4 | on 30 SEP 2021 | in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, AWS Inferentia | Permalink |  Comments |  Share\nMore customers are finding the need to build larger, scalable, and more cost-effective machine learning (ML) inference pipelines in the cloud. Outside of these base prerequisites, the requirements of ML inference pipelines in production vary based on the business use case. A typical inference architecture for applications like recommendation engines, sentiment analysis, and ad ranking need to serve a large number of models, with a mix of classical ML and deep learning (DL) models. Each model has to be accessible through an application programing interface (API) endpoint and be able to respond within a predefined latency budget from the time it receives a request.\n\nIn this post, we describe an inference architecture, developed in collaboration with the Commerce Einstein Team at Salesforce, built on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) to not only address the base prerequisites, but also pack thousands of unique PyTorch DL models in a scalable architecture. We explore a mix of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance families (c5, g4dn, Inf1) to develop an optimal design from a cost and performance aspect. To meet these requirements, we build the DL inferencing service on Amazon EKS using FastAPI, a lightweight and efficient Python-based API server, and develop a model NAME_5 packing strategy to efficiently share compute and memory resources between models. To load test the architecture, we use a natural language processing (NLP) open-source PyTorch model from huggingface.co (bert-base-cased, approximately 800 MB) and simulate thousands of clients sending simultaneous requests to the service pool. We use AWS Inferentia, the custom ML chip on Inf1 instances, to package and serve 3,000 unique PyTorch models while keeping the cost below $50/hour (On-Demand pricing), with a round trip latency of 70 milliseconds (P90) versus our target of 100 milliseconds. You can extend this architecture and optimization approach to any custom DL model.

Ce qui était sans doute une incongruité. Et ce le serait plus encore aujourd'hui, alors que se joue justement avec la guerre lancée par la Russie contre l'Ukraine voisine, tout simplement l'avenir de notre continent et qui se joue aussi pour beaucoup dans cette région. Et d'autant que nous sommes aussi à l'orée d'un mois qui résume l'ampleur de nos enjeux stratégiques avec le sommet de la Communauté politique européenne demain à Chisinau, puis un Conseil européen important pour l'avenir de notre Union au mois de juin et enfin le sommet de l'OTAN à Vilnius. Et au fond, avec ces échéances, je crois utile de vous livrer avec beaucoup de liberté comment je vois les choses du moment que vit notre Europe sur le plan géopolitique.\nVoilà presque 20 ans, notre Union ouvrait ses portes à la Slovaquie et à d'autres pays libérés de l'emprise soviétique. Ce n'était alors pas seulement un élargissement de notre Union, c'était le retour dans notre famille de ceux dont nous avions été trop longtemps séparés. Et je ne crois pas, en effet, qu'il y ait une Europe occidentale et une Europe orientale, ou une vieille Europe et une Europe nouvelle. Ce serait perpétuer la frontière artificielle imposée pendant des décennies par l'Union soviétique. Il n'y a qu'une Europe. Une seule trame faite d'histoires mêlées, de diversités, mais avec cette volonté d'unité géographique, géopolitique et de bâtir au fond un récit commun. Je crois que c'est ce qui nous réunit tous derrière ce projet, qui n'écrase pas nos identités nationales et nos projets nationaux, mais nous permet de les conjuguer dans un récit qui les dépasse.\n

Extract clinical features from this text (parsed as a list in brackets [HPO name\n| HPO ID]): "A three-generation Han Chinese pedigree was recruited at the Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China (Figure 1A). The proband (II-3) is a 49-year-old female who was born to non-consanguineous parents. She presented a progressive proximal muscle weakness and initially had complaints of upper limb weakness and unable to run at age 39. At present, she had difficulty in raising arms, walking at a fast pace and getting up from squatting position. She had no complaints of distal muscle weakness, myalgia, dysphagia, dysarthria, ptosis, or numbness. Neurologic examinations revealed evident bilateral winging scapula, atrophy of both deltoids and shoulder girdle muscles, and pseudo-hypertrophy of bilateral upper arm muscles. Power testing revealed grade 4/5 at both proximal lower limbs and upper limbs, and 5/5 at both distal muscles. Sensory examination was normal. Her CK was elevated at 260 U/L (normal range 40–200 U/L). The electromyography (EMG) showed myopathic features in the upper proximal muscles (Figure 2A). She has no significant extramuscular symptom. The 46-year-old younger sister (II-5) suffered from similar weakness in limbs for ten years and had the same progressive history as the proband. The proband’s mother (I-2) is 81 years old, whose initial symptom is mild weakness of her arms and difficulty in running at the age of 41 years. The disorder was slowly progressive. At present, she is unable to walk and raise arms above the head (Table 1)."

But they manage the pensions of more than a third of the UK's workers so are an influential voice.\n\nNAME_3 received a majority of more than 90% for re-election during the annual meeting on Thursday.```
