I am convinced hard work is nessesary but not enogth for success. Humans life is not a straigh line, we every day face with unexpected things and events which are often byend our control. The obvious thing that we can not choose is our family. Often rich people are just children of their rich parents, on the other hand ordinary farmers children have to hard work in a village to continue family traditions. However there are a lot of examples when famous persons children lose all that they got from the parents because they were lazy and irresponsible. Sometimes you work is directly connected to luck, like financial analytics, investors or even scientists. For instance different scientific groups work in many directions developing their own theories. But after additional experiments only one of them will reflect the truth. In this example only the people who have guessed the right way will succeed. Summarise all above, I believe that hard work and

Profits from the auction at the Hard Rock Cafe in New York's Times Square crushed pre-sale expectations of only $120,000 in sales. The highly prized memorabilia, which included items spanning the many stages of NAME_1's career, came from more than 30 fans, associates and family members, who contacted NAME_3's Auctions to sell their gifts and mementos of the singer. NAME_1's flashy glove was the big-ticket item of the night, fetching $420,000 from a buyer in Hong Kong, China. NAME_1 wore the glove at a 1983 performance during "Motown 25," an NBC special where he debuted his revolutionary moonwalk. Fellow Motown star NAME_4 NAME_5 of the Commodores, who also performed in the special 26 years ago, said he asked for NAME_1's autograph at the time, but NAME_1 gave him the glove instead. "The legacy that [NAME_1] left behind is bigger than life for me," NAME_5 said. "I hope that through that glove people can see what he was trying to say in his music and what he said in his music." NAME_5 said he plans to give a portion of the proceeds to charity. NAME_6, who bought the glove on behalf of Ponte 16 Resort in Macau, paid a 25 percent buyer's premium, which was tacked onto all final sales over $50,000. Winners of items less than $50,000 paid a 20 percent premium. "\n\nAnswer the questions with the given information.

She wanted him to take charge of her cattle and horse and ranges, and save them if that were possible. Yet, though she could not have spoken aloud all she meant, she was perfectly honest with herself.

When NAME_9 led out this slender, beautifully built horse NAME_2 suddenly became all eyes. A rider's love of a thoroughbred shone in them.

Based on the following text alone, answer these questions:\n1. Where did Surrealism originate?\n2. What are three elements of Surrealism?\n3. Who coined the term "Surrealism?"\n4. What year was the Surrealist movement established?\n5. Who wrote the Surrealist Manifesto? \n\nSurrealism is a cultural movement that developed in Europe in the aftermath of World War I in which artists depicted unnerving, illogical scenes and developed techniques to allow the unconscious mind to express itself.[1] Its aim was, according to leader NAME_1, to "resolve the previously contradictory conditions of dream and reality into an absolute reality, a super-reality", or surreality.[2][3][4] It produced works of painting, writing, theatre, filmmaking, photography, and other media.\n\nWorks of Surrealism feature the element of surprise, unexpected juxtapositions and non sequitur. However, many Surrealist artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost (for instance, of the "pure psychic automatism" NAME_2 speaks of in the first Surrealist Manifesto), with the works themselves being secondary, i.e., artifacts of surrealist experimentation.[5] Leader NAME_2 was explicit in his assertion that Surrealism was, above all, a revolutionary movement. At the time, the movement was associated with political causes such as communism and anarchism. It was influenced by the Dada movement of the 1910s.[6]\n\nThe term "Surrealism" originated with NAME_3 in 1917.[7][8] However, the Surrealist movement was not officially established until after October 1924, when the Surrealist Manifesto published by French poet and critic NAME_1 succeeded in claiming the term for his group over a rival faction led by NAME_4, who had published his own surrealist manifesto two weeks prior.[9] The most important center of the movement was Paris, France. From the 1920s onward, the movement spread around the globe, impacting the visual arts, literature, film, and music of many countries and languages, as well as political thought and practice, philosophy, and social theory.

The show acoustics were fantastic, I have spent many drunken nights across the street and did not know this gem existed. I grabbed a burger which was fantastic and a couple of drinks. I the drinks are a bit pricey but it's a club so it's not the place to try and tie one on. Our server was also amazing I was so caught up in the atmosphere I forgot to get their name.

"Answer in the context of this thesis abstract.\n""Based on what was learned in developing a price prediction algorithm for ALLESkralle GmbH, this study aims to explore the use of machine learning algorithms to analyze medical laboratory test results for predicting a patient's chronological age. The approach involves analyzing the anonymized medical records in MIMIC-IV Clinical Database developed and published by MIT's PhysioNet. We aim to identify the features that have the most significant impact on a patient's predicted age. The results demonstrate the potential of machine learning for personalized medicine and suggest the possibility of developing new diagnostic tools for predicting clinical outcomes.\nProblem Area: \nPrediction of housing prices, and the estimation of an individual's age.\nResearch Questions: \n• How accurately can we predict the price of a house based on its characteristics and location? \n• Which features have the most significant impact on the price of a house? \n• Can routine blood test results be used to estimate an individual's age accurately? \n• Which parameters have the most significant impact on the prediction?\nAims: \nDevelop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a house based on its characteristics and location. \nDevelop a machine learning model to estimate an individual's age based on their blood test results.\nMethods: \nRegression-based machine learning algorithms and feature engineering techniques to select the most relevant features for the model.\nResults: \n

Here is an example:\n  Story: (some story)\n  Questions: [Q1, Q2, Q3]\n  Answers: [A1: {answer: answer to the question, span_start: start pos. of span, span_end: end pos. of span}]\n  Now, here is the real story and the questions:\n  Story: Once upon a time, in a barn near a farm house, there lived a little white kitten named NAME_1. NAME_1 lived high up in a nice warm place above the barn where all of the farmer's horses slept. But NAME_1 wasn't alone in her little home above the barn, oh no. She shared her hay bed with her NAME_2 and 5 other sisters. All of her sisters were cute and fluffy, like NAME_1. But she was the only white one in the bunch. The rest of her sisters were all orange with beautiful white tiger stripes like NAME_1's NAME_2. Being different made NAME_1 quite sad. She often wished she looked like the rest of her family. So one day, when NAME_1 found a can of the old farmer's orange paint, she used it to paint herself like them. When her NAME_2 and sisters found her they started laughing. \n\n"What are you doing, NAME_1?!" \n\n"I only wanted to be more like you". \n\nNAME_1's NAME_2 rubbed her face on NAME_1's and said "Oh NAME_1, but your fur is so pretty and special, like you. We would never want you to be any other way". And with that, NAME_1's NAME_2 picked her up and dropped her into a big bucket of water. When NAME_1 came out she was herself again. Her sisters licked her face until NAME_1's fur was all all dry. \n\n"Don't ever do that again, NAME_1!" they all cried.

Question# 01: Please answer these short questions. Answers should be in one\nline (at NAME_1 it can be 2 lines). (20 Pts)\na. Why is Von Neumann Architecture best suited for general purpose microprocessors?\n(1 Pt)\n\nb. What kind of modifications are required to port a C-Code written for Intel\nMicroprocessor to AMD Microprocessor? (1 Pt)\n\nc. Consider a microcontroller having Harvard architecture with 32-bit address bus and\n32-bit data bus of Program Memory and 16-bit address bus as well as 16-bit data bus for\nData Memory. The registers are 32-bit wide and ALU operates on registers. What can we\nsay about the architecture (16-bit/32-bit) of the microcontroller?\n(1 Pt)\n\nd. What does a 16-bit Program NAME_2 tell us about the capacity of Program Memory of a\nmicrocontroller?\n(1 Pt)\n\ne. Why does a microcontroller always execute a program at location 0x0000 of\nATMEGA16A? (1 Pt)\n\nf. In the case of LDI R16, 0xFE instruction, which data memory location does the value\ncome from?\n(1 Pt)\n\ng. Consider a microcontroller operating on 1.0 MHz which fetches an instruction and then\nexecutes it. How many instructions per second can be obtained from this microprocessor\nin case of pipelining and without pipelining?\n(1 Pt)\n\nh. Consider the following code\n(1 Pt)\n.EQU ALPHA 14\nLDI R17, ALPHA + 1\nHow many memory locations of Program Memory will be required to store this program?\n\ni. Why are IN/OUT instructions preferred over LDS/STS in ATMEGA16A? (1 Pt)\n\nj. Consider the following code\n.ORG 0x0012\nNAME_3: nop\nnop\nrjump NAME_3\n\nWhich address in data memory this instruction jumps to? (1 Pt)\n\nl.

There is only 1 interrupt line associated with each peripheral such as Timer0, Timer1,\nUART, ADC, SPI etc. Please comment. (1 Pt)\n\nn. Assume we have configured an external interrupt with level triggering (high level) and all\nregisters are properly configured to service the interrupt in Atmega16A. The interrupt\nline goes high, even then the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) is not being called. What\ncould be the reason? (1 Pt)\n\no. We have enabled interrupts for all the peripherals including Timer0, ADC, UART and\nSPI. What do you think which interrupt will be handled first?\nEven after enabling individual interrupts, none of the ISRs get executed. What do you\nthink could be the reason?\n(1 Pt)\n\np. In serial communication, how can you ensure whether data has been received at the\ndestination or not? If there is no mechanism then can you suggest one? (1 Pt)\n\nq. We can detect an

Answer the questions about the given text:\n\nHas the structure in the text been followed: 1. introduction 2. personal opinion 3. conclusion?\nHave words and expressions in the text been used correctly and appropriately, both simple and more complex?\nAre there any lexical errors in the text?\nHave grammatical constructions in the text been used correctly?\nAre there any grammatical errors in the text?\nAre there any spelling errors in the text?\nAre there any punctuation errors in the text?\nWhat is the CEFR level of this text?\nIn my opinion, success is mostly related with hard work. If you start work on you, youll become better than you were yesterday. This fact is very simple, but on the other hand, it will grow a great person inside you. You shouldnt look to other people because the great enemy of yours is yourself. What is success? Is it having a will to get something or become someone? I think, if you have an opportunity to buy something, it can not be called a success. But if you made that opporutniy from nothing, I can say that you succeed. But how did you get an opportunity? If you only depend on NAME_1 , it is possible to get some opportunity, but then nothing can use it but you, even your NAME_1. Hard work is basic. Due to hard work you can get anything you want. Maybe it takes much time , but the result would be sweet. NAME_1 is only a small percent of your success. I dont believe in talant from birth, only hard work.Many people think that money and success is equal, some poeple think that NAME_1 and success is equa
