She presented a progressive proximal muscle weakness and initially had complaints of upper limb weakness and unable to run at age 39. At present, she had difficulty in raising arms, walking at a fast pace and getting up from squatting position. She had no complaints of distal muscle weakness, myalgia, dysphagia, dysarthria, ptosis, or numbness. Neurologic examinations revealed evident bilateral winging scapula, atrophy of both deltoids and shoulder girdle muscles, and pseudo-hypertrophy of bilateral upper arm muscles. Power testing revealed grade 4/5 at both proximal lower limbs and upper limbs, and 5/5 at both distal muscles. Sensory examination was normal. Her CK was elevated at 260 U/L (normal range 40\u2013200 U/L). The electromyography (EMG) showed myopathic features in the upper proximal muscles (Figure 2A). She has no significant extramuscular symptom. The 46-year-old younger sister (II-5) suffered from similar weakness in limbs for ten years and had the same progressive history as the proband. The proband\u2019s mother (I-2) is 81 years old, whose initial symptom is mild weakness of her arms and difficulty in running at the age of 41 years. The disorder was slowly progressive.

Have you had any chest pain or anything?\nPATIENT: No chest pain. No shortness?\nPATIENT: You know when it gets real hot. Right. My hand. Okay. My hand.\nDOCTOR: Okay. One of your heart markers was a little bit high, but I think that's from the fall and from everything with that. Probably. So we're going to check the heart out today. We'll get an echocardiogram to look at that. We'll keep looking at your labs. And work on getting your heart rate a little bit better today, okay?\nPATIENT: Okay.\nDOCTOR: And then we're going to try to work on getting you into the living facility there in Newton County. Oh. Okay.\nPATIENT: The nursing home. Yeah.\nDOCTOR: Yeah. So and then I'll follow you there. I'm taking over there from Dr. Smith and Dr. Johnson, so I'll take care of you there.

Power testing revealed grade 4/5 at both proximal lower limbs and upper limbs, and 5/5 at both distal muscles. Sensory examination was normal. Her CK was elevated at 260 U/L (normal range 40\u2013200 U/L). The electromyography (EMG) showed myopathic features in the upper proximal muscles (Figure 2A). She has no significant extramuscular symptom. The 46-year-old younger sister (II-5) suffered from similar weakness in limbs for ten years and had the same progressive history as the proband. The proband\u2019s mother (I-2) is 81 years old, whose initial symptom is mild weakness of her arms and difficulty in running at the age of 41 years. The disorder was slowly progressive. At present, she is unable to walk and raise arms above the head (Table 1).",
