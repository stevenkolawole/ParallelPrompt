The results demonstrate the potential of machine learning for personalized medicine and suggest the possibility of developing new diagnostic tools for predicting clinical outcomes.\"\n\nProblem Area:\nPrediction of housing prices, and the estimation of an individual's age.\n\nResearch Questions:\n\u2022 How accurately can we predict the price of a house based on its characteristics and location?\n\u2022 Which features have the most significant impact on the price of a house?\n\u2022 Can routine blood test results be used to estimate an individual's age accurately?\n\u2022 Which parameters have the most significant impact on the prediction?\n\nAims:\nDevelop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a house based on its characteristics and location.\nDevelop a machine learning model to estimate an individual's age based on their blood test results.\n\nMethods:\nRegression-based machine learning algorithms and feature engineering techniques to select the most relevant features for the model.\n\nResults:",

NAME_1 lived high up in a nice warm place above the barn where all of the farmer's horses slept. But NAME_1 wasn't alone in her little home above the barn, oh no.

The rest of her sisters were all orange with beautiful white tiger stripes like NAME_1's NAME_2. Being different made NAME_1 quite sad. She often wished she looked like the rest of her family. So one day, when NAME_1 found a can of the old farmer's orange paint, she used it to paint herself like them. When her NAME_2 and sisters found her they started laughing. \n\n\"What are you doing, NAME_1?!\" \n\n\"I only wanted to be more like you\". \n\nNAME_1's NAME_2 rubbed her face on NAME_1's and said \"Oh NAME_1, but your fur is so pretty and special, like you. We would never want you to be any other way\". And with that, NAME_1's NAME_2 picked her up and dropped her into a big bucket of water. When NAME_1 came out she was herself again. Her sisters licked her face until NAME_1's fur was all all dry. \n\n\"Don't ever do that again, NAME_1!\" they all cried. \"Next time you might mess up that pretty white fur of yours and we wouldn't want that!\" \n\nThen NAME_1 thought, \"I change my mind. I like being special\".\n  Questions: ['What color NAME_3?', 'Where did she live?', 'Did she live alone?', 'Who did she live with?', 'What color were her sisters?', 'NAME_3 happy that she looked different than the rest of her family?', 'What did she do to try to make herself the same color as her sisters?', 'Whose paint was it?', \"What did NAME_1's mother and siblings do when they saw her painted orange?\", \"Where did NAME_1's mother put her to clean the paint off?\", 'What did the other cats do when NAME_1 emerged from the bucket of water?', 'Did they want NAME_1 to change the color of her fur?']",
